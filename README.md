# Build a Movie Recommendation Model with Apache Spark and Amazon EMR

This project is to implement a movie recommendation model using Apache Spark and Amazon EMR.

## Getting started

`movie.ipynb` is the IPython Notebook exported from DataBrick, but it does not have the running result.

`movie.html` is the notebook in HTML format exported from DataBrick. It includes the running result. It is available on  https://opw0011.github.io/COMP4651_Movie_Recommendation_Model/movie.html
